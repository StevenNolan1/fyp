**Abstract**

**Part A -- Description of Research and Investigation:**

For this project I plan to research what web applications are out there
from just a quick look I plan to use Django and compare it to a php
framework and a java/c# framework.

I will also research various security methods to ensure the project is
secure.

**Part B -- Description of Software Development and Demonstration:**

This project will help users to track their expenses, create budgets and
visual their spending habits.\
some features of this project may include: expense categorisation,
budget planning, transaction history and data visualization

## 1.0 Introduction and Scope

In this project I plan to build a functional application in 2 if not 3
languages and compare the ease of which the apps are built, the speed of
the user interface, the testability of each app.

I plan to research different web applications, security measures for web
applications and how each framework works.

The goals for this application are to build the same application over 3
frameworks, the application should help users to create budgets and
visualise their spending habits.

## 2.0 Plan of Work -- Research and Investigation

I plan to use the initial 2-3 weeks on research and investigations on
the best framework for each language that would suit the needs of this
project. And what are some of the advantages and disadvantages of
certain frameworks.

## 3.0 Plan of Work -- Software Development, Demonstration, or 'hands on' work

I plan on using an agile approach when creating this project.

I plan on setting sprint goals and at the end of each sprint be able to
demo my project to my supervisor.
